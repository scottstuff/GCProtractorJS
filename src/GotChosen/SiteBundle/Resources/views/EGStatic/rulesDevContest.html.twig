to increase the number of votes and plays of their game. A developer must also rate as much feedback as possible received from the players.</p>

<p>The Qualifier Ranking System is a computer generated number that determines the position of each developer in the Qualifier Round. </p>

<p>The developer’s rank is generated at the end of each day. The top developers with the highest rank at the end of that Round
will advance to the next Contest Round.</p>

<p>The criteria used to generate the developer’s rank are applied in the exact order below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Number of votes.</li>
<li>Number of plays.</li>
<li>Number of feedback rated by the developer received from the players.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: The three criteria listed in the order above were designed to resolve any tie in the rank position between developers.</p>
