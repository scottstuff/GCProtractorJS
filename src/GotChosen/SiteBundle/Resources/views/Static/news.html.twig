                            to win a scholarship. Eric will be at the University of Central Florida studying mechanical

                            to do as a way to earn money," Eric said. "When I saw that I could dance, I was extremely excited.
                            I immediately began to film for my video, which was of my break-dancing, and applied as soon as
                            possible."

                            task mostly because there were so many out there, but so few that I felt adequately equipped to
                            apply for. When I discovered GotChosen, I immediately knew that this was an opportunity for me
                            to showcase my editing and cinematography skills that I acquired throughout my years of academic
                            and professional experience."

                            and, at this time, I am invaluably grateful for this scholarship.  This scholarship will help me
                            have a few less expenses than I would normally have.  For that, I couldn’t be more appreciative."

                        conservation and management. Kellie has a story that many can relate to and hopefully learn from. Kellie told us "I heard
                        about the GotChosen scholarship through <a href="http://www.fastweb.com" target="_blank">Fastweb.com</a>. I saw how easy
                        the application was and thought, <em>why not?</em> I sent around the sponsor link to my family and friends but none of us
                        honestly believed that I would win."

                        "I had tried really hard for a similar scholarship the year before," Kelly said.  "We were all so disappointed when I lost
                        that we didn’t really get our hopes up for this one. Suffice to say that I nearly lost my mind from happiness when I found
                        out I had won!"

                    <p>
                        "It was one of the best days of my life," she continued. "Right alongside the day I was accepted into college. I am so
                        thankful I found this scholarship".

                        Kellie, with her family's support, began college without having all the funds to pay for it. She has worked hard every year
                        and each summer to help pay the bills and has also taken on student debt. And every year, Kellie searched for new ways to
                        cover her college. She has a "never give up" attitude. We are excited to follow Kellie as she finishes her degree and uses
                        the scholarship to pay down her student loans.

                    <p>
                        I found out about this scholarship through my study abroad program IES Abroad. Receiving
                        these funds is very exciting as I am studying abroad in Barcelona, Spain this summer and they will
                        greatly contribute to my program fees. Thank you GotChosen for helping me have a once in a lifetime
                        summer experience".  Caitlin is a student at <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/" target="_blank">University of Texas, Austin</a>. She is studying Government
                        and is looking forward to her summer program to be able to compare different governmental policies
                        and procedures.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        GotChosen is always excited to support the educational goals for students. We are confident that
                        Caitlin will represent the University of Texas and her country, with pride and professionalism. We
                        hope Caitlin will experience the distinctiveness of Barcelona as well as the uniqueness of humanity
                        that unites us all.

                        worlds collide, cultures mix, and diversity is a fact of life. All of which make Orlando, FL, the

                        offers an opportunity to study with faculty from diverse backgrounds and extensive theological prowess.
                        This makes the Florida Dunnam campus culturally relevant for the growing multicultural, multi-ethnic

                        Brian Banks, the Associate Director at Asbury drew the winner’s name using GotChosen’s platform
                        integration with Random.org. Mr. Banks is often on the road speaking to future students. He appreciated
                        the opportunity to be on campus to work with GotChosen and help make college dreams come true for
                        students seeking ways to fund their educational expenses.

                        The February winner, Shania, wrote about winning the $1000 Every Month Scholarship "I am very grateful
                        and blessed to have been awarded this money. It’s going to be of great use to me when I go to
                        <a href="http://www.gvsu.edu/" target="_blank">Grand Valley State University</a>. I definitely didn’t
                        expect to win when I read it was a drawing. I figured the odds were huge so I was shocked to receive an
                        email saying I was the winner.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I applied because college isn’t cheap. The more money you can get the better. The whole process to apply
                        was very easy. You make an account then your name is entered into the drawing. Now my books are covered
                        and I have GotChosen to thank for that".

                    <p>
                        GotChosen is pleased to support Shania. She made a small investment of time by registering and applying
                        for the GotChosen scholarships and received a substantial award for that investment.

                        Erin Walters will be thinking about her decision to apply for GotChosen's scholarship often, as she enjoys
                        her summer abroad program. As Erin said - "it was so easy" and taking a few minutes to apply for the drawing
                        has paid off.

                    <p>
                        I have been working my way up in the medical field. I started working as a Lifeguard at the YMCA and recently just
                        attended the Congress of Future Medical Leaders in Washington D.C. With this scholarship I will be able to pay for
                        my tuition and books. I am so glad to receive this scholarship and be financially sound. When I got the news that I
                        won the scholarship I was stunned. I feel truly blessed by this opportunity. Thank you".

                    <p>Marlana stated "it had been five years and I knew if I wanted to go back to school I needed
                        to get started before I had the expense of a family; I went ahead and started my Master's knowing
                        God would provide. I was about to drop my winter courses to cover the additional expenses we were
                        having during the holidays. I had been applying for scholarships at fastweb.com. Fortunately, I had
                        applied for a monthly scholarship with GotChosen. When I received an e-mail that I had won the

                        dreams. His support of GotChosen's efforts to make a difference reflects his own vision to help students.</p>

                    <p>Rajohn knows the need for dedication to complete his education.  He wanted to apply that same effort
                        to pay off his student loans. As he learned about the GotScholarship $40K Give Away, he told us "a thing
                        like this is definitely motivation for people like me, paying student loan debt or for others preparing
                        to go back to school.  I also have been trying to get sponsors to increase my chances for the $40,000
                        award in early 2014. It was a really easy process and I have recommended all of my college friends to
                        sign up and apply. Thanks to GotChosen, I have $1000 less to pay back in student loan debt".

                </div>

                <p>GotChosen will continue to help students and those who have student loans. We believe in giving a chance
                    to students and their families to follow their dreams.  Congratulations again to Rajohn.</p>

                <h1>GotChosen Congratulates the third $40K GotScholarship Winner - 10/30/2013</h1>

                <p>It is the drive to "Do Good" that continues to be GotChosen’s inspiration to help students like Jaime
                    McElyea, our 3rd $40K GotScholarship Give Away winner.</p>

                <img src="{{ asset('bundles/gotchosensite/images/Jaime1.jpg') }}" alt="Jaime 1"
                        style="margin-bottom: 8px;" />

                <p>When we informed Jaime she was the winner, her genuine surprise and disbelief was apparent. We asked
                    how she learned about our scholarship programs. Jaime said "I discovered the GotChosen scholarship
                    while searching through a long list of scholarships on Fastweb.com."</p>

                <p>Jaime went on to say the $40K Give Away was perfect because "upon discovering how simple it was to
                    apply for the scholarship on the GotChosen website, I decided to give it a shot. All I had to do was
                    create an account. Like many others, I had applied for as many scholarships as possible in order to
                    help ease the financial burden of attending college."</p>

                <div>
                    <img src="{{ asset('bundles/gotchosensite/images/Jaime2.jpg') }}" alt="Jaime 2"
                         style="float:right; margin:0 0 8px 8px" />
                    <p>As a junior at The University of Oklahoma, Jaime is in the Nursing Program. Jaime said "Growing up I
                        always wanted to work in the medical field and help people, which is why I chose my degree in
                        nursing. As a future healthcare employee I understand the need to further my education in order to
                        be able to give the best care possible."</p>
                </div>

                <p>With more than half her college courses completed for her BSN, Jaime is now even more excited,
                    because "Thanks to GotChosen I now have an amazing opportunity. Receiving this scholarship in the
                    latter half of my education will not only allow me to complete my bachelor’s degree, but will be
                    applied towards a master’s in nursing as well."</p>

                <p>GotChosen is now a true partner with Jaime. For the next four years the GotChosen team will be
                    encouraging and supporting Jaime. We are confident; with her dedication she will bring her knowledge
                    and passion to those in need of quality healthcare.</p>

                <p>Jaime wants to say "I applaud GotChosen for their scholarship program and providing others an
                    opportunity to complete their degree and further their educations." We want to say we applaud her
                    and every participant in our scholarship programs. Every student is teaching us and the rest of the
                    world to never give up.</p>

                    <p>GotChosen knows paying for college can be as challenging as succeeding in college for many students
                        today. Understanding this financial reality, Joy Brastrom, Director of Education, representing
                        Anthem College (Orlando Campus) hosted the September random drawing. Ms. Brastrom and her staff,
                        instructors and administrators are exceptional in supporting their students' college dreams and
                        career paths.</p>
                </div>

                <p>GotChosen would like to extend our thanks to Anthem College and Ms. Brastrom for making the

                <p>Our <a href="{{ path('monthly_scholarship') }}">$1000 Every Month Scholarship</a>
                    winner deserves the full spotlight. Sergeant Scott Higgins is
                    currently deployed in Afghanistan, serving our country and ensuring our freedom. It is with pride
                    GotChosen will be supporting SGT Higgins pursue his Masters.</p>

                            style="float:left; margin:0 8px 8px 0" />
                    <p>Scott shared with us, "when I began my mission to further my education in 2008 I had a goal to obtain
                        my Masters in Business
                        Administration within 5 years. With years of deployments and training I had to take breaks between
                        classes in order to focus on my training and missions. When returning back in 2011 for an extended
                        period of time I was able to bolster my efforts and attend school full time. As I continued my
                        education I realized that my yearly Federal Tuition Assistance was not going to cover my yearly
                        school expenses forcing me to pay out of pocket. In trying to save money for a family I started
                        looking for alternatives to assist in paying for school. After months of researching internet sites
                        and companies I had created a few accounts with reputable sites. One
                        site led me to GotChosen.com where I could easily apply for scholarships continuously.</p>
                </div>

                    <p>For the past 2 years with the lack of government budget bills being passed on time many to include
                        myself are left waiting for funding or paying out of pocket. This year I was once again left paying
                        for expenses out of pocket. Luckily with the awarding of this scholarship I can continue to my
                        coursework without incurring more debt during these economically uncertain times. I do not possess
                        the verbal diction to describe my gratitude as this scholarship will allow me to continue my
                        education without another long break.</p>
                </div>

                <p>I am closing in on my next "mile mark" in my coursework and was dreading the upcoming break I was
                    going to be forced to take. Thanks to GotChosen.com I can continue my classes uninterrupted".</p>

                <p>It is always a great day for the GotChosen team to travel to a local school to randomly draw the next
                    scholarship winner. <a href="http://www.anthem.edu/orlando-florida/">Anthem College - Orlando Campus</a>
                    was the host school for our September drawings.
                    Working with their administrators, who are very commitment to each member of their student body, was
                    an excellent blend of our missions. GotChosen would like to extent our thanks to Anthem College and
                    Valerie Rodriquez for making the scholarship drawing so special.</p>

                <p>GotChosen congratulates Sergeant Scott Higgins on winning and more importantly wishes protection and
                    a safe return to his family in the USA soon.</p>

                <p>It was very exciting to go to the <a href="http://www.first.edu">F.I.R.S.T Institute</a>,
                    (Florida Institute of Recording, Sound and
                Technology) surrounded by the most up-to-date technology for film and recording students. The photos
                tell the story of this school's commitment to give students the real life and hands-on experience to
                enter the workforce prepared.</p>

                        Program Director, Film and Video Program, our partner from F.I.R.S.T Institute, drew the
                    August scholarship winner, Ashley Hughes in a random drawing. Ms. Hill's support of our scholarship
                    program is a direct reflection of her commitment to support the dreams of students to advance their
                    education.</p>

                </div>

                <p>Ashley was so thrilled to learn her name was drawn and shared this story about her experience. "I am

                        and couldn't believe all you had to do was create a profile,
                    and then you were automatically entered into the drawing.</p>
                </div>

                <p>So I decided to apply for the scholarship since it was so easy and I definitely needed the money for
                college expenses. When I was notified that my name was chosen I really was astonished because it was so
                easy and I didn't do anything, but create a profile on their website. Thank you GotChosen Inc. for
                giving me this wonderful opportunity". Ashley is studying at the
                    <a href="http://www.georgiahealth.edu/medicine/about.html">Medical School of Georgia</a>.</p>

                <p>By the end of 2013 GotChosen will have awarded $138,000 in scholarships. We want you to have an

        <p><strong>Fabain Calallero created the video &ldquo;To Be&rdquo;:</strong> I was accepted to Hunter College in
            New York City earlier this year. During the last two years I have developed an interest in film, and
            recently decided it was time to go back to school, after a three-year absence, to pursue a career in the
            field. I had no idea how I was going to pay for this endeavor. My parents have no money and, due to my
            immigration status, I am not eligible to receive any federal aid. I began searching online for scholarships
            for which I was eligible and stumbled upon the <em>Got Chosen-Lights, Camera, Action Video Scholarship
                Contest</em>. It was a true blessing to find out about this scholarship. Not only was I eligible, but it
            also involved filmmaking and music, my two passions. I made a music video for one of my original songs and
            applied to the contest.</p>

        <p>The hardest part of this process was not only creating the video, but also getting people to vote for it on a
            daily basis. The voting phase was the most nerve-wracking because you had to remain in the top 20 to stay
            alive in the contest. I was constantly checking the Got Chosen site to see what place I was in. The last day
            of the voting phase I went on the site to check my status and I was in 20th place. I posted the video online
            to get as many people as possible to vote in the last stretch and hoped for the best. When I checked my
            status on the Got Chosen site the morning after the voting phase ended, I was relieved to see that I was
            still in the top 20, barely hanging in there at 20th place. It was well worth the trouble because now I have
            money to pay for school, and I learned a bit about how to market myself online. Every vote counts in this
            contest. </p>

        <p>I feel honored to have been chosen as the winner by the panel of judges. I could not believe it when I saw
            the e-mail notification. It has taken an immense load off my shoulders. I encourage everyone to apply for
            this. It is an amazing opportunity to use your art to get money for school. </p> <img alt=""

        <p><strong>Emina Sonnad created the video &ldquo;Rainbowfish-Here I am&rdquo;:</strong> When I came across
            GotChosen&rsquo;s video scholarship, it immediately seemed like the perfect choice for me, as I love making
            videos to express myself in creative ways. Even better, I&rsquo;m a singer and songwriter, so I had no
            shortage of material to use for the &lsquo;original music&rsquo; category. I grabbed my sister, my ukulele,
            a video camera, and a close friend and hiked to the top of a hill where we could film our song before
            sunset. That was the easy part. Next, I had to get votes. Using Facebook, email, Instagram, and old
            fashioned face-to-face begging, I explained my situation and asked for people to vote for me daily if they
            liked my song. We also posted the link frequently on our band&rsquo;s Facebook page and I was amazed at the
            amount of support we rallied. I think a lot of people were able to connect with the emotion behind the song,
            and I&rsquo;m incredibly grateful for every vote I got. Being chosen as a winner was such a thrill, and I
            would recommend this contest to everyone, because you definitely get what you put into it. </p> <img alt=""

        <p><strong>Amanda Neuhouser created the video &ldquo;Waiting&rdquo;:</strong> I found out about GotChosen
            through my mom who was looking for scholarship opportunities that would suit me best. After looking at the
            GotChosen website, I decided this would be a great chance for me to get my skills out there and possible
            earn money in the making. After I found out I was one of the runner-up's I was very excited because I needed
            this money to help pay for all of my books in college. I started College this year at SIU Carbondale and I'm
            majoring in film production. I encourage everyone to apply for this scholarship because it is super easy to
            apply and it will give you great exposure. </p>

                Community College, Jake heard about the contest from Fastweb and is excited to place as a runner up. He's
                planning to use the money for one of his most immediate college expenses - likely it will be for books.</p>

            <p><strong>Emily Hoven created the video &ldquo;Oh The Places You&rsquo;ve Gone&rdquo;:</strong> I found out
                about the contest while browsing Google for scholarships to apply for. I spend a lot of my time creating
                videos to post on YouTube, so this contest was right up my alley! In university, every little bit helps;
                this scholarship will help alleviate some of the stress that comes with paying tuition, which will allow
                me to focus more on my studies.</p></div>

                        You have completed your education and now you have a new road to travel - unfortunately
                        for many graduates this means student loan debt.

                        for scholarships to help reduce the debt.

                        and cannot contribute. It had been very stressful; winning the GotChosen scholarship

                    The Winner's Story from GotChosen's Video Scholarship - 4/23/2013
                </h1>
                <div class="news-content">
                    <p> <img alt="" style="width: 168px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px; float: left;" src="{{ asset('bundles/gotchosensite/images/Kirk.jpg') }}" /> Hello! My name is Kirk Saechao and I am the winner of GotChosen&rsquo;s Lights, Camera, Action Video Scholarship. I am a second year student at San Diego State University, majoring in computer engineering. I found out about the scholarship entirely by chance. I am involved with a fraternity called Alpha Phi Omega. Every week, we host a general meeting and we have a segment dedicated to presenting the membership body with both an internship and a scholarship. It just so happened to be my week to find a scholarship so I logged onto my Zinch account. I was scrolling down the list full of different scholarships and saw &lsquo;GotChosen&rsquo;s Video Scholarship&rsquo; contest. Reluctantly, I pressed on the link and read the information about it. I had never really made short films before, but had been in charge of taking pictures and creating Recap Videos of events for many organizations on campus. The scholarship competition began about a month prior to my finding out about it, and there had been already over two hundred entries. My chances seemed slim at best. I wasn&rsquo;t going to enter at first but a little voice in my head told me to just give it a shot. There was nothing to lose!</p> <p> Many people don&rsquo;t know, but I have always been an avid gamer, so I wanted to create a story that would reflect that geeky side of my personality. I wanted to create a storyline that many people in the gaming world would be able to connect with; yet at the same time, be likeable by those who have never touched a video game. I opted to use an extremely popular massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) called &lsquo;MapleStory&rsquo; that I used to play as a kid and most of my friends used to play when they were younger as well. The game encourages social networking and interaction between players. In the midst and chaos of slaying monsters and completing dungeons, players often start to develop feelings for other players in this online game. And thus, I stumbled upon the foundations of my story; a boy and a girl falling for one another in an online video game. Two days of filming and several hours of editing later, &lsquo;Maple Love Story&rsquo; was completed with the help of my roommate and two close friends.</p> <p> <img alt="" style="width: 277px; padding-top: 10px; padding-left: 15px; float: right;" src="{{ asset('bundles/gotchosensite/images/Kirk2.jpg') }}" /> But perhaps making the short film was the easy part, the hard part was to get people to actually watch and vote for my video. Throughout my college experience, I networked and made a point to meet as many people as possible. I am very deeply involved with many Asian-American groups on campus plus I am a member of a large national fraternity. I went out to these groups and asked them for their support in my endeavor to which they happily obliged. I posted my story and video link on my social networking websites and nothing could have prepared me for what was to come. By the end of the first week, the outpour of support I received was unbelievable. My news feed on social networking sites were being flooded with support for my video, friends began telling their friends from other schools to watch and support, and the views on my video were jumping by the hundreds. Employees over at Nexon, the company that created MapleStory, caught whiff of my story and video, and contacted me telling me that they had shared my video on their official Twitter and Tumblr accounts. Colleagues at school told me they heard about my cause and were voting every day. Before long, my submission shot up to first place and I was quite literally in shock. Down to the last 24 hours, the contest was neck and neck. I woke up many days in second place and would reclaim first by the time I had went to bed. I like to guess that I had a group of over two hundred people strong standing behind me the whole way. In the final hours, we rallied together and made a final push. When the polls closed at 8:59:59 on the west coast, I was still on top. It was such a surreal time in my life and was nothing short of a Cinderella story.</p> <p> The scholarship prize money is definitely nothing to scoff at. College students know that any amount of money, whether $20 or $500, is extremely helpful. The money would be used to ease the huge financial burden of college; it wouldn&rsquo;t be fair to my supporters to use it any other way. Also, the fact that I&rsquo;ll be able to sustain myself throughout summer means that I won&rsquo;t have to get a job, so I can catch up on my units in summer school and perhaps get an internship with reputable videography companies in the area. It&rsquo;ll also allow me start putting away my own money in hopes of saving up for better equipment so I can replace my outdated gear. This is the end of my story! </p> <p> Thanks again to GotChosen for such an enormous opportunity!</p> <p> By Kirk Saechao<br/><em>Winner of GotChosen's "Lights, Camera, Action" Video Scholarship.</em> </p>

                    <p><img alt="" width="300" style="padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px; padding-bottom: 15px; float: left;" src="{{ asset('bundles/gotchosensite/images/Craig_Domeck.jpg') }}" /><em>Craig Domeck, Ed.D., Dean of </em><a href="http://www.pba.edu/orlando"><em>Palm Beach Atlantic University &ndash; Orlando</em></a><em> </em>&nbsp;selected the winner of the 2<sup>nd</sup> GotScholar &nbsp;ship $40K Give Away . Dr. Domeck<strong>&lsquo;s</strong> involvement with the GotChosen scholarship reflects his commitment to support the dreams of students looking for ways to pay for college that will reduce &nbsp;future financial burdens. </p>
                    <p>The 2<sup>nd</sup> GotScholarship $40K winner was drawn using &nbsp;<a href="http://www.random.org/">www.random.org</a> with oversight&nbsp; from Kathy Voldseth, CPA, Manager, Assurance Services from the auditing firm<strong> </strong><a href="http://cfrcpa.com/">Cross, Fernandez and Riley, LLP</a><strong>. &nbsp;</strong>The True Random Number generator scientifically ensures every entry has an equal chance of winning. </p>
                    <p><img alt="" width="223" style="padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 15px; float: right;" src="{{ asset('bundles/gotchosensite/images/carmela_and_daniel.jpg') }}" />The results were a family affair. Carmela Guerriero-Cuccio was the randomly drawn winner of the 2<sup>nd</sup> &nbsp;$40,000 scholarship offered by GotChosen, Inc. Ms. Cuccio stated &ldquo;I am so thrilled that my name was drawn and even more ecstatic that I can transfer this prize to my cousin Daniel. He will make great use of this scholarship and absolutely deserves it.&rdquo; </p>
                    <p>&nbsp;Why would someone give away $40,000 to a cousin? Daniel Guerriero of New Jersey, the final winner of the 2<sup>nd</sup> GotScholarship $40K Give Away learned about the scholarship while he was on <a href="http://www.fastweb.com/">Fastweb.com</a>. Daniel said &ldquo;I was looking at all of the possible scholarships I was eligible for I figured that I might as well give this scholarship a shot. It was really simple to sign up for the scholarship&rdquo;. </p>
                    <p>When Daniel realized he could increase his chances of winning with sponsors, he sent some friends and family members invitations to support him. His cousin, Carmela, who took out student loans while pursuing her Masters, took the few minutes needed to apply since the winnings were transferable, and became his sponsor. </p>
                    <p>After finding out he won, Daniel shared &ldquo;Carmela always has been very supportive of me in all of my endeavors ever since I was a little kid. Thanks to Carmela, I am now the proud winner of this coveted scholarship&rdquo;. At the next Guerriero family holiday there will be lots to talk about.</p>
                    <p>GotChosen scholarship programs encourage families, teachers, coaches and friends to become sponsors so they can support participants&rsquo; college dreams. Asking for sponsors helps students articulate their plans to pay for a college education. And when the sponsor also applies for the scholarship, they are providing two additional entries for the participant.</p>
                    <p><img alt="" width="262" style="padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px; padding-bottom: 15px; float: left;" src="{{ asset('bundles/gotchosensite/images/Oz_Silva_and_Dean_Craig_Domeck.jpg') }}" />Mr. Oz Silva, Founder and CEO of GotChosen, Inc., made his commitment to college education when his company was just starting &ldquo;we did not feel we could wait to &ldquo;make it&rdquo; before we started giving back&rdquo;. The burden of student loans debt is a global problem. For many students throughout the world, paying for college can be a bigger challenge than going to college.&nbsp; Mr. Silva is determined to change the financial future of current and prospective students nationally and internationally &ndash; one student at a time.</p>
                    <p>GotChosen offers several scholarship opportunities. In addition to the GotScholarship, they recently launched the Lights, Camera, Action Video Scholarship which will award $3000 to the video with the most votes. The newest program is the GotChosen $1000 Every Month Scholarship. A new winner will be randomly chosen every month. All scholarship winnings must be used for educational expenses or repayment of current student loans.</p>

                    The Winner's Story from the second GotScholarship - 4/10/2013

Carmela Cuccio was asked by her cousin Daniel to sponsor him for a scholarship drawing. &nbsp;Even though there is a 20 year age difference, Ms. Cuccio shared they have always been close. Carmela knew well the burden of student debt, having used student loans to finance her Master&rsquo;s program. Ms. Cuccio stated &ldquo;GotChosen is doing something wonderful by offering students the opportunity to follow their dreams without continuing to incur further debt simply by entering a contest&rdquo;. </p>
                    <p>Taking only a few short minutes, Carmela willingly became a sponsor for Daniel. She also applied for the scholarship, knowing it would be 100% transferable if she won. This decision gave Daniel two more entries for the scholarship and that was what he needed to ultimately become the final winner of the 2<sup>nd</sup> GotScholarship $40K Give Away.</p>
                    <p><img alt="" width="168" style="padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px; padding-bottom: 15px; float: left;" src="{{ asset('bundles/gotchosensite/images/daniel_winner.jpg') }}" />Ms. Cuccio stated &ldquo;I am so thrilled that my name was drawn and even more ecstatic that I can transfer this prize to my cousin Daniel. He will make great use of this scholarship and absolutely deserves it.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>Daniel Guerriero of New Jersey received a call from his cousin Carmela. &nbsp;Daniel shared &ldquo;when she told me that she had an &ldquo;Easter gift&rdquo; for me, I was a little confused. She then told me the fantastic news. She had won this amazing scholarship and was transferring the prize to me. I remained speechless for a good five minutes only able to produce the words, Oh my,&rdquo; and he had to wait to hear it officially from GotChosen. </p>
                    <p>When Daniel was asked how he learned about the GotScholarship he said &ldquo;I thought it was way too good to be true. However, while I was on FastWeb.com looking at all of the possible scholarships I was eligible for I figured that I might as well give this scholarship a shot. It was really simple to sign up for the scholarship&rdquo;. </p>
                    <p><img alt="" width="150" style="padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 15px; float: right;" src="{{ asset('bundles/gotchosensite/images/happy_dance.jpg') }}" />Daniel realized he could increase his chances of winning with sponsors, so he sent some friends and family members invitations to support him. This decision changed Daniel&rsquo;s life. &ldquo;I am one of the youngest members of the Guerriero family and hoping to become the first member of my immediate family with a college degree. &nbsp;This scholarship takes away a good amount of the financial burden of college and is something I will be truly grateful about for many years to come.&rdquo; </p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Carmela always has been very supportive of me in all of my endeavors ever since I was a little kid. Thanks to Carmela, I am now the proud winner of this coveted scholarship&rdquo;. Daniel plans to complete his studies at University of South Carolina and continue on for a Masters in physical therapy.</p>

                    <p>Hello everyone! My name is David Fitzpatrick and I am a junior attending Montgomery Community College in Maryland. First off, let me start out by saying how grateful and honored I am to be randomly chosen for this scholarship. </p>
                    <p>Currently, I am studying as an Environmental Science and Policy Major and would like to finally transfer to the University of Maryland. Winning this scholarship will aid me in my self-perpetuating odyssey to help our planet.</p>
                    Like many of you, I too registered for an account that organizes and notifies me of current scholarships available, which is how I stumbled across the GotChosen scholarship giveaway. My purpose for applying for this scholarship was probably the same as yours; to augment my financial aid and ease the burden of college debt on my family.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    <p>Although the odds did not seem in my favor, I pushed myself to realize that this giveaway was chosen at random and that sponsors will increase my chances of winning. For those of you who are familiar with the book <i>The Hunger Games </i>by Suzanne Collins, the only way to explain how I feel right now is to imagine that you&rsquo;ve emerged victorious from the Hunger Games with the help of your sponsors. </p>
                    <p>This scholarship will certainly be put to good use towards my tuition, debt, and books. Additionally, I will hand down any money I do not use. This scholarship provides a tremendous opportunity for me to pursue my education goals in environmental science and policy. Thanks to this scholarship, I will do my absolute best to make a change and I will not let any of you down. </p>
                    <p>Once again, I am truly grateful for this opportunity. I do not know if it was fate or luck; however, I do know you could win this scholarship too.</p>

                <div class="news-content">
                    <p style="margin: 12pt 0in 3pt;">With the registration period for the first GotScholarship: $<i>40K to Give Away</i> drawing ending on September 30th, GotChosen has even bigger plans in mind. &nbsp;While the participation of students and friends has been very successful, GotChosen CEO, Oz Silva, said &ldquo;I was intrigued by the diversity of website visitors from over 7,000 cities in over 100 countries." &nbsp;He added that many of the locations were ineligible for the scholarship. &ldquo;While student debt in the U.S. is greater than anywhere else, it is clear students and their families in other countries are searching for solutions too.&nbsp; <s></s></p>
                    <p style="margin: 12pt 0in 3pt;">Although as part of phase 1 of the business plan, the <i>GotScholarship:</i> <i>$40K to Give Away</i> drawing was begun primarily as the GotChosen branding strategy while the company developed its innovative next generation services, Silva soon realized that the situation of college debt required a more comprehensive long term solution. &nbsp;Accordingly, Silva announced both more than 10 new scholarships and&nbsp;GotChosen international expansion to Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Columbia, and Chile.</p>
                    <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><b><br />
                            Scholarship and Website News</b>: To inaugurate phase 2 of the GotChosen business plan, a new $40K to Give Away drawing will begin in October, 2012, and will be available to participants in all six countries. &nbsp;Students in those countries will also be eligible to participate in a Video Contest Scholarship based on optional preselected subjects.&nbsp; There will also be two monthly scholarships contest (starting in January&nbsp; 2013), one for the North American bloc, and the other for the Latin American bloc.</p>
                    <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">Also as part of phase 2, a completely revised GotChosen website will be published in October in English, Spanish, and Portuguese.&nbsp; The new GotChosen website will feature mobile-friendly multilingual registration and navigation features that will be implemented throughout October and November.</p>
                    <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><b>Summary: </b>GotChosen&rsquo;s roadmap began with the GotScholarship: $40K to Give Away drawing, the largest single private national scholarship initiative ever seen in the United States. &nbsp;Going international expands the market and more importantly, the benefits to be derived from GotChosen&rsquo;s growing portfolio of scholarships.</p>
                    <p>Silva says, "The comments from students and others registering for our initial scholarship confirms how serious our educational and student loan situation is, and how important it is for everyone to try to do something about it. Fortunately, that's our business, and we look forward to helping as many individuals as possible over the coming years."</p>

                    <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">GotChosen will not duplicate existing social networking sites.&nbsp; Instead GotChosen will provide a new user interface that encourages enrolled students and potential students to interact with each other and with educational institutions both domestically and internationally.&nbsp; &nbsp;This will provide students with unprecedented opportunities to network and explore potential degree programs, research opportunities, athletics, and facilities available to them at universities all over the world.&nbsp; When students become contributors by responding to questions they open the door to new friends.&nbsp; Potential students can connect online before they move, so once they arrive on campus they may already know some fellow students, making the transition to college life a bit easier. </p>
                    <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">To accomplish this GotChosen will create a searchable database to allow students to make inquires and utilize filters to focus on the information most important to them.&nbsp; This will make it possible to compare potential universities and programs to find the one most suited for them and their career choice.&nbsp; GotChosen will become a valuable service that will help students make informed decisions about their future.&nbsp; This social networking utility will offer outstanding results with real benefits.</p>
                    <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">In addition to this remarkable database, we will also feature forums.&nbsp; These may include but are certainly not limited to subjects such as proprietary university scholarships, and discussions about the advantages and disadvantages of attending various schools, athletic programs, the merits of potential degree programs and the learning possibilities provided by studying abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                    <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">GotChosen would like to make these outstanding tools available to as many students as possible.&nbsp; To accomplish this, the GotChosen website will feature mobile-friendly multilingual registration, navigation, and participation, as well as enhanced integration with Facebook and other social networking sites.</p>

                    Student Debt is a Worldwide Problem - 9/25/2012

                <div class="news-content">
                    <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">While issues surrounding student debt regularly make headlines in the United States, they are equally serious in many other parts of the world. &nbsp;Even though the colossal size of the nearly $1 trillion dollars in U.S. student debt dwarfs the amount of student debt in other countries, the problems that student debt have created elsewhere are no less serious. </p>
                    <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">In many countries, parents must co-sign all student debt. &nbsp;In others, the interest rate (about 10% in Mexico, for example) is far higher than in the U.S. &nbsp;In Chile, there are more than 100,000 student loan defaulters that owe an average of $5,400 each, which is about a third the country&rsquo;s annual per capita income.* There have been demonstrations and protests throughout the world, and the situation remains a challenge as economies everywhere face financial difficulties, and governments continue to reduce the amount of money they devote to support both educational institutions and student loans.</p>

                    <p> </p>
                    <p><strong></strong></p>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p><strong>Orlando, FL, May 1, 2012 &ndash; </strong>Today,<strong> </strong>GotChosen, Inc. (www.gotchosen.com), an innovative digital media and development company headquartered in Orlando, FL, is launching the largest scholarship drawing in the nation titled, &ldquo;GotScholarship: $40K to Give Away!&rdquo;<em> </em>&nbsp;There is no cost to participate, and the company will award $40K to one winner with a dream of attending college, or to pay for existing college loans. The scholarship may also be transferred by the winner to an individual of any age to pay for educational expenses.</p>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p><strong></strong></p>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p>The concept for the company was conceived during the economic struggles of 2008 by Founder and CEO, Oz Silva.&nbsp;Silva&rsquo;s focus was to assist anyone with the desire of completing their degree in higher education, but who did not have the financial means to do so. Silva&rsquo;s philanthropic interest developed the first phase of the corporate vision beginning with the $40K scholarship drawing. The program will instantly establish GotChosen&rsquo;s primary mission of assisting individuals and families to achieve their educational potential and life aspirations, and to introduce the company on a large national scale. Subsequent drawings will enlarge the scope of the company&rsquo;s endeavors, but will remain focused on the college market.</p>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p>&ldquo;An essential element of the core values of GotChosen is a deep-rooted need and desire to give back,&rdquo; said Silva.&nbsp;&ldquo;Our team is eager to witness the wonderful things that will be done by the recipients, and to how this scholarship will change their futures. We hope that our donation to their dreams was the difference that made it all possible.&rdquo; </p>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p>The amount of student loans acquired in 2011 crossed the $100 billion mark for the first time in history, and total loans outstanding will exceed $1 trillion for the first time this year. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the U.S. Department of Education, and private sources report that Americans now owe more on student loans than on credit cards. &nbsp;</p>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p>As the cost of higher education continues to increase, the traditional channels for student loans and grants are being limited by ongoing credit tightening, economic weakness, and governmental policies. &nbsp;For some, this situation creates an insurmountable obstacle to a college education, making the $40,000 scholarship from GotChosen a new potential way for students to achieve their goals. &nbsp;</p>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p>The GotChosen scholarship is open to all: current students, previous students with outstanding loans, or even future college students. It is free and easy to enter, as well as being 100% transferable. In addition, the more individuals recruited to enter the contest on a student&rsquo;s behalf, the more potential entries will exist to increase the student&rsquo;s chances of winning.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>You may register to enter for your chance to win the GotScholarship: $40K to Give Away Drawing by visiting the GotChosen website at: www.gotchosen.com beginning May 1, 2012 and the contest will close on September 30, 2012.</strong></p>

                    <p>&ldquo;This is only the first phase of our efforts,&rdquo; Silva further added. &ldquo;We anticipate creating a long line of scholarship recipients who will benefit.&nbsp; It is an exciting time for our young company, and we are hopeful that we will become a powerful creative and economic contributor for many years to come.&rdquo;</p>
